# Arrays

In this assignment, you will be creating four functions: **min**, **max**, **sum**, and **average**.  The input to each function will be an array of numbers.

### min
**min** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the minimum.  Then it will log the minimum value to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The minimum value is 1.
```
---

Input:

```
[30, 20, 10]
```

Output:
```
The minimum value is 10.
```

### max
**max** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the maximum.  Then it will log the maximum value to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The maximum value is 5.
```
---

Input:

```
[30, 20, 10]
```

Output:
```
The maximum value is 30.
```

### sum
**sum** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the sum of the array.  Then it will log the sum to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The sum of the array 15.
```
---

Input:

```
[30, 20, 10]
```

Output:
```
The sum of the array is 60.
```

### average
**average** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the average of the values.  Then it will log the average value to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The average of the array is 3.
```
---

Input:

```
[30, 20, 10]
```

Output:
```
The average of the array is 20.
```

# triangle

You will be creating functions **triangleFor** and **triangleWhile**.  The input to each will be a number corresponding to the number of rows of the triangle.  Your goal is to print a one-sided triangle of hashmarks with the expected number of rows. To do this, you will use 'for' loops in **triangleFor** and 'while' loops in **triangleWhile**.

### Examples:

Input:

```
5
```

Output:
```
#
##
###
####
#####
```
---

Input:

```
3
```

Output:
```
#
##
###
```

# paceKnights

In this assignment, you will be creating functions **paceKnightsFor** and **paceKnightsWhile**.  The input to each will be a number corresponding to the number of rows of output.  If the output is a multiple of 3, then you will output 'Pace'.  If the output is a multiple of 5, then you will output 'Knights'.  If the output is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, then you will output 'Pace Knights'.  If the output is neither a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 5, then you will output the number. To do this, you will use 'for' loops in **paceKnightsFor** and 'while' loops in **paceKnightsWhile**.

### Examples:

Input:

```
5
```

Output:
```
1
2
Pace
4
Knights
```
---

Input:

```
20
```

Output:
```
1
2
Pace
4
Knights
Pace
7
8
Pace
Knights
11
Pace
13
14
Pace Knights
16
17
Pace
19
Knights
```

# sum35

In this assignment, you will be creating a function **sum35** that solves a math problem.  The input to your function will be a number *N*.  The problem is to find all the multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than *N* and to add them up.  The function should then print the number of multiples along with the sum.

### Examples:

Input:

```
6
```

Output:
```
There are 2 multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than 6.
Their sum is 8.
```
---

Input:

```
20
```

Output:
```
There are 8 multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than 20.
Their sum is 78.
```

---

Input:

```
1000
```

Output:
```
There are 466 multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than 1000.
Their sum is 233168.
```

### countVowels
The input to **countVowels** will be string.  Your function should log the string as well as the number of vowels in that string.

Input:

```
Hello
```

Output:
```
You entered 'Hello'.
It has 2 vowels.
```
---

Input:

```
My name is Sarah.
```

Output:
```
You entered 'My name is Sarah.'.
It has 6 vowels.
```
