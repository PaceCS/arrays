# Arrays

In this assignment, you will be creating four functions: **min**, **max**, **sum**, and **average**.  The input to each function will be an array of numbers.

### min
**min** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the minimum.  Then it will log the minimum value to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The minimum value is 1.
```
---

Input:

```
[30, 20, 10]
```

Output:
```
The minimum value is 10.
```

### max
**max** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the maximum.  Then it will log the maximum value to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The maximum value is 5.

```
The sum of the array 15.
```
---

Input:

```
[30, 20, 10]
```

Output:
```
The sum of the array is 60.
```

### average
**average** will take an array of numbers as an input and find the average of the values.  Then it will log the average value to the console.

Input:

```
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```
The average of the array is 3.
